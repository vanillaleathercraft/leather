## About
Template files were created with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) and are in that application's format for easy modification as well as PDF.

These templates allow you to create your own leather items using materials and construction of your choice. Modify as needed to compensate for differences in materials. These were originally created for 8-10 oz English Bridle leather with 4 oz New Zealand deer liners.

## Cuffs & Collars

###### Double Rivet Cuffs
This template is inspired by [Church of Sinvention's](https://www.churchofsinvention.com/) "Padded Medical Bondage Cuffs" modified with choice of slotted or round holes and various widths. Slotted holes work with locking buckles while round holes provide more adjustment points. Builder may choose lining material, hardware, and stitching color. I've had great success with 4oz New Zealand deer for liners without padding.

###### Double Rivet Cuffs
Similar to the "Double Rivet" design, but modified to use a single rivet on each side of a closure for a more sleek look. Recommend using larger rivets to keep the Ds from sliding around too much.

###### Slot Cuffs
Inspired by the practical aspects of Humane Restraint medical cuffs, these are meant to be used with a padlock. They are quick to apply and remove thanks to not needing to pull a belt tight to get a snug fit.

###### 3-Ring Bondage Collar
This template is inspired by [Church of Sinvention's](https://www.churchofsinvention.com/) "DeLuxe Leather Slave Collar", with modifications similar to the Double Rivet Cuffs.

## Harnesses

###### Muzzle Harness

This template is inspired by the aesthetic of various muzzle harnesses I've seen around the 'net, including the Insex, the TiedStyle [face hugger](https://www.deviantart.com/tiedstyle/art/FaceHugger-771251797), the [Top to Bottom Leather](https://www.top-to-bottom-leathers.co.uk/Bondage-Equipment/Bondage-Gags/Ultimate-Bondage-Gag-Harness.htm) ultimate bondage gag harness, the [House of Basciano](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HouseofBasciano) padded muzzle harness, and others. It works by applying pressure to the lower jaw to hold the mouth closed. It also looks cool.

###### Breast Harness

This design was made based on chest harnesses seen online. It can be worn as a normal chest harness, or with the breast squeezer strap to apply a desired amount of pressure to the breasts.
